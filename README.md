# TvT
(TvT is such a bad name, but I cant think of anything else- HELP ME AHHHHH)

Just your run of the mill streaming platform. Supports a variety of movies and shows pulled from the The Movie Database, otherwise known as TMDb coupled with a few embed APIs for your viewing pleasure. Should be easy enough for most folks to use!
